                <p>
                    The studio was founded by Shantel Kristian in October 2017 under the name “Sky Yoga.” Shantel poured her heart and soul into renovating the beautiful studio space and sharing her love of yoga and aerial arts with those around her. 

In November 2019, Rachel Lane walked into Sky Yoga hoping to have some fun with her daughter to make up for a missed Thanksgiving vacation. That day changed her life forever. 

Rachel immediately fell in love with aerial. It wasn’t easy, but she loved the challenge. The bruises and aerial burns were real, but she kept going back. Over the next 9 months, she would end up losing almost 40 lbs and finding muscles she never knew she had. Rachel tried Lyra for the first time in June 2020 and discovered her ultimate passion. 

Rachel continued to be an active member of the studio up until she became an instructor in July 2021, teaching beginner level Lyra classes and filling in occasionally for her fellow instructors. 

When Shantel reached out to Rachel about buying the studio in September 2021, it was a huge shock!  Sky Yoga was her happy place. The thought of being able to bring this amazing art to others as a studio owner was so exciting! Rachel recruited her friend, Tristen Lang, as her business partner and started putting together a plan. 

Roughly a month later, Studio Sky was official. Since true yoga hadn’t been a main focus for the studio for a little over a year pre-purchase, Rachel and Tristen decided to give the studio a more all-encompassing name while staying true to it’s roots. 

Studio Sky wouldn’t be here  today without Shantel’s vision and Sky Yoga. Rachel and Tristen hope to continue sharing her passion, energy, and love for all things aerial for years to come.

                <p>
                    Aerial yoga, also referred to as anti-gravity yoga, shares a lot similarities with traditional yoga. However, there’s a big difference. When participating in aerial yoga classes, the weight of your body will be supported by a hammock. This means you’ll be suspended in the air! It’s a great option for beginners and experienced yoga performers.
                </p>
         
                <h2 class="benefits">WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF AERIAL YOGA?</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Great for Back Sufferers  <p>While everyone can benefit from aerial yoga classes, they’re especially great for people experiencing back pain. Because of the hammock’s support, far less pressure is placed upon your joints. Aerial yoga also doesn’t strain the spine, which is a huge advantage for back pain sufferers. You’ll be able to obtain a full body workout without any discomfort.</p></li>
               
                <li>Helps with Breathing  <p>Controlled breathing is an important aspect of yoga. Aerial yoga allows you to breathe deeply with any restriction. While hanging in the air, you’ll be able to totally relax. Aerial yoga enables you to comfortably maintain every pose. Over time, you can even expect to improve your lung capacity.</p></li>
               
                <li>Enhances Flexibility <p>In order to maintain a great range of motion, you must consistently work on your flexibility. Aerial yoga class will definitely help you to safely stretch your muscles and tendons. Being suspended in the air gives you more space to move. This means you’ll be able to perform yoga poses that you can’t do on the floor.</p></li>
                
                <li>Stress Relief  <p>Don’t underestimate the stress relief that stems from participating in aerial yoga classes. If you happen to be going through a rough time or experiencing anxiety attacks, aerial yoga will help put your mind at ease. It gives you an opportunity to meditate and focus on positive thoughts (while hanging upside-down!). Beyond just stress relief, the pros of being inverted include increased balance, more energy, and better focus. When you’re inverted, blood flows to your brain and provides oxygen it needs for brain function.</p></li>
               
                <li>Burns Calories <p>Aerial yoga offers more than just peace and relaxation. It also helps burn calories through the balance it takes to stay control in the silks. Being suspended in the air requires a stable core as you change positions in a way a mat yoga class can’t. In fact, a study performed by the American Council on Exercise shows aerial yoga rivals the effectiveness of aerobic exercise. During a 50-minute aerial yoga session, you have the potential melt away 320 calories. After six weeks, your risk of cardiovascular disease will be significantly lower.</p></li>
